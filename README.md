# Simulation-of-cognitive-radio-Networks-
Study project based on the simulation of cognitive radio networks to achieve better energy efficiency 
This code simulates the primary and secondary user behaviour based on the exponential arrival and exponential service rates and improves the overall utliziation of the channel bandwidth.
We just need to set the arrival and serivce rates for PU, RSU and NRSU followed by selecting the number of channels we want to incorporate in the bandwidth and then run the simulation and note our recordings.
